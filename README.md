# Osu! Hosting Lobby with AI Management

## Overview

Beware of the fact that this is a fork! it is meant to look over the original repository, not replace it. It is possible that i update this repo, but not likely. **If you want to have the latest features, check out the main repo.**

This is an overview of the original repo, with changes on the back-end and some front-end minor changes based on my preferences.
Furthermore, i do not guarantee the 100% reliability of the code. this is a small hobby project, and i would like it to stay like that.

if you want a full in depth installation guide and documentation, make sure to check out the main repo, the installation will be the same.
